PiCade
======

Overall, this project will bring together the use of classic game controllers that are connected to the GPIO pins of the Raspberry Pi.
It is to accompany a hardware module which is currently in the process of manufacturing and testing.

This code needs the BCM 2835 library installed. It can be downloaded at http://www.open.com.au/mikem/bcm2835/.
Furthermore, the uinpit (and i2c-dev for Wii classic controller support) modules has to be loaded (e.g., with "modprobe uinput" and "modprobe i2c-dev").

Raspberry Pi is a trademark of the Raspberry Pi Foundation.

SNES controller support entirely from Florian Muller and his SNESdev project (https://github.com/petrockblog/SNESDev-RPi)
